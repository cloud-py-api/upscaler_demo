## Nextcloud Image Upscaler Example

Demonstration of using [AppAPI](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/app_api) and File Actions.

This application is an example, but the model used in it is quite large, and it is recommended to use a GPU.

It shouldn't be difficult to use an even more advanced model based on this example and release a full application.

Refer to [How to install](https://github.com/cloud-py-api/upscaler_example/blob/main/HOW_TO_INSTALL.md) to try it.
